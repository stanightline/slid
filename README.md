SLID - Super Lightweight Information Database

Extension upon Kezz101's **lid** project, but with no in-browser editing.

The goal of this project is to create a deployable one-page contact information database which has an easily
editable database file, and has contact information well displayed.

The current GitHub Pages deployment is live [here](https://tomcontileslie.github.io/slid/src/).
