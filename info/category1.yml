    SLID is a super lightweight fork of Kezz101's LID (Lightweight Information Database) under MIT license. <br>
    This project runs through GitHub and produces a single webpage, which you see rendered here, which acts as a database where each database entry is a card.

- title: This is a card.
  content: |
    A card must contain a title and some content. It can optionally contain an image and/or links. <br>
    The card style is from Materialize.css. Cards are arranged on the page by Isotope.js, and can be filtered and sorted using the search bar and buttons above.

- title: This card has an image.
  image: sunset.jpg

    To add an image to a card, first add an image to the src/img/cards folder. I added one called sunset.jpg. Then, in the entry corresponding to this card in its .yml file, add a line saying "image: sunset.jpg".
