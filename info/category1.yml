- title: This is a card.
  content: A card must contain a title and some content. It can optionally contain an image and/or links. The card style is from Materialize.css. Cards are arranged on the page by Isotope.js, and can be filtered and sorted using the search bar and buttons above.

- title: This card has an image.
  image: sunflower.jpg
  content: To add an image to a card, first add an image to the src/img/cards folder. I added one called sunflower.jpg. Then, in the entry corresponding to this card in its .yml file, add a line saying "image: sunflower.jpg".
