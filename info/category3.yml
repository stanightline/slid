- title: This is a card from a third category.
  content: |
    That means its content is stored in a different .yml file to all the cards before. Say you want to create a new category, called "beans". All you need to do is add a "beans.yml" file to the info/ folder, and specify the colour you want that category to have in the file builder/style.py. When you make those changes to the GitHub repository, all the other changes happen automagically!
